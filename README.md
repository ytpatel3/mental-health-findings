Original Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/mental-health-dataset?resource=download

Project Overview/Purpose: Provide analysis of correlations and patterns between mental health indicators to the Mental Health Association of New Jersey. These insights can inform interventions, policies, and support systems aimed at promoting mental well-being. Furthermore, the dataset offers opportunities for developing predictive models to identify or predict mental health outcomes based on textual data. This can be useful for early intervention and support.

5 Exploratory Questions: 
- Is there a correlation between gender and treatment seeking?
- Is there a correlation between days spent indoors and social weakness?
- Is there a correlation between occupation and growing stress?
- Is there a correlation between family history and personal mental health history?
- Is there a correlation between mood swings and work interest?
